Welcome to OpenPnP 2.0!

Your configuration is safe.

OpenPnP 2.0 is a major update to OpenPnP and includes many new features and changes to existing
features. As part of this upgrade, you will need to reconfigure your machine, but don't panic. Your
old configuration is still available and you can downgrade back to 1.0 very easily. Keep reading.

For a list of all the changes in OpenPnP 2.0, please go to Menu -> About.

OpenPnP uses a new configuration directory. Instead of .openpnp it uses .openpnp2. Your old
configuration, if you had one, is still in .openpnp. If you would like to downgrade back to
1.0 please download the Stable version from http://openpnp.org/downloads/.

If you are interested in trying the new features in OpenPnP, please be aware that it is currently
under heavy development and breaking changes are expected to happen regularly until at least
the third quarter of 2019.

If you have any questions, or problems, or just want to discuss the new features, please join
the discussion group at http://groups.google.com/group/openpnp.

Thanks for trying OpenPnP 2.0. Onward!
